## Inspiration
When our dear sister had feared threats from mobs when her voice was curbed and justice was not served to mention there was no proof of event occurred, it made a strong mark for us to build something for all sisters and mothers facing harassment in the world. Looking at our mothers hurry in finding an electrician plumber when it was a need we thought what if all is in the fingertip. And when an accident occurred in front of us and we had no idea where to take him/her due to lack of ambulance and idea about *PROPER* Health care centre we aimed to give solution and this is the origin of *MITRA*
## What it does
It provides technical support for workers in hiring, it acts as an emergency centre to allocate hospital and ambulance or any emergency services in need, It acts as your personal vehicle security and of course, it is a voice for the need. It provides a forum for women to express their thoughts and connect to the world.
